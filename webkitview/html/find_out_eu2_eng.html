				<p class="heading center">The proposal for a legal framework under which different types of investment fund can be granted the status of 'European Venture Capital Fund' and a venture capital 'passport'. The aim is to create a European venture capital investment sector for small and medium-sized enterprises. The proposal for a regulation sets out the criteria that a fund must satisfy in order to be granted the aforementioned status and passport. It also sets out the requirements to be fulfilled by venture capital fund managers and the restrictions on the investments that can be made using a fund's assets.
