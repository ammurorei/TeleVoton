				<p class="heading center">At the local level, for the elections of the members of the parliament the vote is determined by lists of candidates for a particular constituency. EU passed a directive to ensure ensure uniform active and passive voting rights for foreigners, nationals of Member States of the EU for the vote to the European Parliament. In the Republic of Slovenia and Lithuania the directive was not passed correctly. In these two Member States, EU citizens who do not have their citizenship, only gain an active and passive right to vote at the elections to the European Parliament after a residence period of 5 years, while other citizens don not have such requirement. The aim of the bill is to implement the directive to the Slovenian legal order and secure the voting rights and the right to stand in local elections by citizens of the EU. In most Member States, the participation at the European elections 07/06/2009 was lower than 50%.
