				<p class="heading center">Price increase for the monthly school ticket at 20 euros. Last balance of prices were processed on 01/08/2007 from 16.69 euros at 17 euros. The proposal for increasing the price from 28/11/2011 has been withdrawn by the mayor, due to the assurance from the responsible national authorities to subsidise school ticket. Discussions with the relevant ministries are still in process, but it is not ensured that the realisation of subsidising the monthly school fares will be carried out. The Public company LPP Inc. recorded 9,566,978.92 euros loss in 2011. To secure an uninterrupted high-quality public service there is an urgent need to improve the revenue structure. The change is expected to increase revenue of LPP of 825,000 euros on an annual basis. For the period from 1/9/2012 till 31/12/2012, it is estimated that the revenue will increase by 320,000 euros.
