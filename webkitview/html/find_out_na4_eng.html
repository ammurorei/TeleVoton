				<p class="heading center">The reorganization will establish a uniform body. The Directorate for Food Safety will be abolished. The phytosanitary inspectors and inspectors working in the field of food will be transferred from inspectorate to a new administration. This will modify sectoral laws, which comprehensively regulate the reorganization of ensuring food safety. Changes in the new law are mandatory introduction of integrated pest management, implementation of the national action plan to reduce risks from plant protection and additional actions in the areas of water resources and special protection areas.
